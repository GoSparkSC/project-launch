<strong>1. Will we have homework?</strong> <br>
<div class= "content-indent-faq">Yes, there will be some expectation to work through Mission content after the Mission with the help of your mentor. We will provide the access to technology that would be required to make this possible.</div> <br/> <br>
<strong>2. What if I canâ€™t follow along with a workshop?</strong> <br>
<div class= "content-indent-faq">While we have thought through our workshops carefully, we understand everyone works at their own pace. Most workshops will have 1-2 extra teaching assistants to help people go at their own pace. And you will have a mentor just for you that can help you understand the material after a workshop. </div> <br/> <br>
<strong>3. Does each workshop have an interactive component? </strong>  <br>
<div class= "content-indent-faq"> Yes, each workshop will have an interactive component where you get hands on experience. </div> <br><br>
<strong>4. When are the workshops for Project Launch? </strong>  <br>
<div class= "content-indent-faq"> Workshops are held Friday 2-6pm. They are on 1/27/2017, 2/10/2017, 2/24/2017, and 3/10/2017. We will additionally have an opening and closing ceremony 1/13/2017 and 4/7/2017. </div><br><br>
<strong>5. Where will these workshops happen? </strong>  <br>

<strong>6. When do the tech tours, <a href="sparksc.org">Spark SC</a> events, and talks happen, given that each 2-6pm Friday session is centered around workshops? </strong>  <br> 
<div class= "content-indent-faq"> Our tech tours, talks, and Spark SC's events will be optional opportunities for Project Launch students and their mentors and will happen throughout the duration the of program on different days and times than the four planned workshops. </div> <br> <br>

<strong>7. Who will be my mentor?</strong>  <br> 
<div class= "content-indent-faq"> We are pairing students with their mentors with a thorough thought process, which includes a personality and interest survey. We may have already decided your mentor or we may have yet to figure out. In any case, you will receive an email connecting you to your mentor by the end of December if you are a part of Project Launch. </div> <br> <br>
