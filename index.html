                We connect USC mentors to <strong>inner-city high school mentees</strong>. Mentors meet with mentees at least twice a month, and help facillitate trips to tech and entrepreneurship hubs in Los Angeles throughout the Project Launch program. Mentees are <strong>matched with relatable mentors who share mentees' interests</strong> and passions. Each of these mentors also has professional experience in their mentee's areas of interest.

                We believe that pairing mentorship with <strong>project-based, skill-focused learning</strong> will help prepare our mentees to be future leaders. The Project Launch program includes 4 workshops, our "Missions", that help mentees build hard and soft skills likely not taught in a traditional classroom. We focus on practical skills that are corequisite in STEM and other fields, and take mentees through a carefully constructed, hands-on curriculum to build these skills. We equip our mentees with a variety of tools, <strong>from hard skills</strong> like coding, designing and video editting, <strong>to soft skills</strong> like working in teams, ideating and sending professional emails. We empower our mentees to be lifelong learners, and teach growth mindset as a tool to help out mentees learn new skills and tackle difficult challenges in the future.

                The final portion of the Project Launch program is the set of resources we provide to our mentees. While in the program, we ensure that they have access to the technology and materials they need to build the skills we focus on. Additionally, <strong>we curate a set of events</strong> that mentors and mentees can attend together, including pitch competitions, career fairs, and tech tours <strong>that introduce mentees to the industry</strong>.
